This folder contains the necessary figures and scripts to reproduce the results obtained in Bridgeford et al. (2024). This folder contains the following contents:

- [The drivers](https://github.com/neurodata/causal_batch/tree/main/docs/batch_effects_paper/data_analysis_scripts), which are the scripts which took connectomes from the CoRR mega-study and produced first-pass processed results (e.g., executed the statistical tests or requisite estimation procedures). These scripts were executed on a high-performance server, and each took approximately 1 week to run on a machine with 100 cores and 1 TB RAM. The necessary raw input data for these scripts can be downloaded from [the neurodata website](https://neurodata.io/mri/), from the subheading "functional MRI" for each dataset in the CoRR mega-study.
- [The processed data](https://github.com/neurodata/causal_batch/tree/main/docs/batch_effects_paper/data), which are the processed derivatives produced by the drivers.
- [Figure reproduction code](https://github.com/neurodata/causal_batch/tree/main/docs/batch_effects_paper/Figure_reproduction), which takes the processed data and produces the figures found in the main content of the manuscript. The figures found in the manuscript were further processed via Adobe Illustrator to fine-tune headings, text sizing, titles, and other non-data-related attributes for the purposes of making them more readable and digestable in the manuscript.
