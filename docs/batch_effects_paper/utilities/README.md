The files contained herein have the following purpose:
- [API spec](https://github.com/neurodata/causal_batch/tree/main/docs/batch_effects_paper/utilities/cond_alg_helpers.R) which wraps methods used in this paper under a consistent API specification,
- [ComBat GAM](https://github.com/neurodata/causal_batch/tree/main/docs/batch_effects_paper/utilities/combat_gam.R) which provides an API for calling the [ComBat-GAM python function](https://github.com/rpomponio/neuroHarmonize) via reticulate, where `neuroHarmonize` is expected to be installed in a python virtual environment named `neuroharm`,
- [ComBat return](https://github.com/neurodata/causal_batch/tree/main/docs/batch_effects_paper/utilities/combat_return.R) to complete many of the simulations in this manuscript required re-writing parts of the codebase for ComBat to return the resulting regression model, which is done here, and
- [simulation helpers](https://github.com/neurodata/causal_batch/tree/main/docs/batch_effects_paper/utilities/sim_helpers.R) which provides numerous utilities for processing and analyzing the simulations in a clear and cohesive manner that would facilitate plotting things such as the fit models, the data after batch effect correction, the fit models after batch effect correction, etc.
